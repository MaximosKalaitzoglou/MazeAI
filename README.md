# MazeAI

  ##### Given a maze find the shortest path to the goal with the least amount of cells explored to get there
  ##### Each transition have a cost of 1.
  ##### Used DFS , UCS and finally A* algorithms
  ##### I developed my own A* that optimizes the cost of exploring the maze cells having at best minimum_path <= cells explored <= 2*minimum_path
  ##### Its a hardcoded solution that makes the optimal choice depending on the position of the player in the maze
  ##### Programming Language used C
